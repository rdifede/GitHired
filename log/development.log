NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

We use innovative technology, a scientific approach, and a deep understanding of markets to stay successful in our highly competitive field. We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don't come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We've got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world's largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you're interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there's no better place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there's a lot of room for growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (<a href=\"http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61\">http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61</a>), and our programming blog (<a href=\"http://ocaml.janestreet.com\">http://ocaml.janestreet.com</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have extensive benefits, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>90% book reimbursement for work-related books</li>\r\n<li>90% tuition reimbursement for continuing education</li>\r\n<li>Excellent, zero-premium medical and dental insurance</li>\r\n<li>Free lunch delivered daily from a selection of restaurants</li>\r\n<li>Catered breakfasts and fresh brewed Peet's coffee</li>\r\n<li>An on-site, private gym in New York with towel service</li>\r\n<li>Kitchens fully stocked with a variety of snack choices</li>\r\n<li>Full company 401(k) match up to 6% of salary, vests immediately</li>\r\n</ul><p>More information at <a href=\"http://janestreet.com/culture/benefits/\">http://janestreet.com/culture/benefits/</a></p>", "website"=>"http://janestreet.com", "type"=>"Full Time", "apply"=>"<p>Please apply through our web app form at  <a href=\"https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/apply/\">https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/apply/</a></p>", "user"=>""}, "commit"=>"view"}

Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.

Noom’s direct-to-consumer weight loss and exercise tracking mobile applications have reached more than 45 million users worldwide. Leveraging the success of their ground-breaking health and fitness programs, Noom developed a behavior change platform to treat chronic and pre-chronic conditions, beginning with the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). On the first day the CDC began recognizing mobile and online DPP providers, Noom was there. Since then, Noom has expanded its curricula across the acuity spectrum and now features programs for pre-hypertension, hypertension and diabetes management in addition to its flagship weight loss and diabetes prevention programs. Noom has offices in New York City, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the U.S. alone spends $3.8 trillion dollars on healthcare, and large chunks of that can be saved by shifting more to prevention. The existing healthcare system has no idea how to do this, and that’s where we come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for a VP of Engineering; a leader, someone who will oversee the engineering organization and help evolve Noom technology, all while keeping the team productive and happy. This person will inspire not only the team, but the entire Noom community, and carry us through the technical challenges and opportunities as we set the standard for wellness intelligence. You will get to lead a team of world-class engineers, help millions of people be healthier, and tackle some of the hardest problem in healthcare and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What You'll Do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Drive technical, architectural, and organizational decisions, making sure we build a scalable, efficient, and maintainable infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>Evolve Noom engineering through best practices, coding guidelines, and design documents, ensuring the organization as a whole feels awesome, top-notch, and fun </li>\r\n<li>Optimize interactions between engineering and other functions, e.g product management, design, marketing, etc. </li>\r\n<li>Help design and refine a scalable engineering culture to accommodate this growth </li>\r\n<li>Be a good career coach and mentor, help engineers grow to be tech leads, and guiding all others towards success</li>\r\n</ul><p>What We're Looking For:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experience leading an engineering team in both a cutting-edge large-scale tech company and in a start-up (team size is less important than what you achieved with it) </li>\r\n<li>An experienced engineer and technical wizard, with the know-how to design complex scalable systems and how to design them correctly </li>\r\n<li>An ability to quickly hold a conceptual and technical grasp of our complex tech stack and infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>A strong leader and great communicator, with a welcoming and supportive personality </li>\r\n<li>Past success creating processes that define a high-quality and enjoyable engineering culture </li>\r\n<li>An inspiring motivator, supporter, and quarterback for the team</li>\r\n</ul>", "website"=>"", "type"=>"Full Time", "apply"=>"<p><a href=\"http://grnh.se/2pl48y1\">http://grnh.se/2pl48y1</a></p>"}, "commit"=>"view"}

Noom’s direct-to-consumer weight loss and exercise tracking mobile applications have reached more than 45 million users worldwide. Leveraging the success of their ground-breaking health and fitness programs, Noom developed a behavior change platform to treat chronic and pre-chronic conditions, beginning with the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). On the first day the CDC began recognizing mobile and online DPP providers, Noom was there. Since then, Noom has expanded its curricula across the acuity spectrum and now features programs for pre-hypertension, hypertension and diabetes management in addition to its flagship weight loss and diabetes prevention programs. Noom has offices in New York City, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the U.S. alone spends $3.8 trillion dollars on healthcare, and large chunks of that can be saved by shifting more to prevention. The existing healthcare system has no idea how to do this, and that’s where we come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for a VP of Engineering; a leader, someone who will oversee the engineering organization and help evolve Noom technology, all while keeping the team productive and happy. This person will inspire not only the team, but the entire Noom community, and carry us through the technical challenges and opportunities as we set the standard for wellness intelligence. You will get to lead a team of world-class engineers, help millions of people be healthier, and tackle some of the hardest problem in healthcare and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What You'll Do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Drive technical, architectural, and organizational decisions, making sure we build a scalable, efficient, and maintainable infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>Evolve Noom engineering through best practices, coding guidelines, and design documents, ensuring the organization as a whole feels awesome, top-notch, and fun </li>\r\n<li>Optimize interactions between engineering and other functions, e.g product management, design, marketing, etc. </li>\r\n<li>Help design and refine a scalable engineering culture to accommodate this growth </li>\r\n<li>Be a good career coach and mentor, help engineers grow to be tech leads, and guiding all others towards success</li>\r\n</ul><p>What We're Looking For:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experience leading an engineering team in both a cutting-edge large-scale tech company and in a start-up (team size is less important than what you achieved with it) </li>\r\n<li>An experienced engineer and technical wizard, with the know-how to design complex scalable systems and how to design them correctly </li>\r\n<li>An ability to quickly hold a conceptual and technical grasp of our complex tech stack and infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>A strong leader and great communicator, with a welcoming and supportive personality </li>\r\n<li>Past success creating processes that define a high-quality and enjoyable engineering culture </li>\r\n<li>An inspiring motivator, supporter, and quarterback for the team</li>\r\n</ul>", "website"=>"", "type"=>"Full Time", "apply"=>"<p><a href=\"http://grnh.se/2pl48y1\">http://grnh.se/2pl48y1</a></p>"}, "commit"=>"view", "id"=>":id"}

Noom’s direct-to-consumer weight loss and exercise tracking mobile applications have reached more than 45 million users worldwide. Leveraging the success of their ground-breaking health and fitness programs, Noom developed a behavior change platform to treat chronic and pre-chronic conditions, beginning with the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). On the first day the CDC began recognizing mobile and online DPP providers, Noom was there. Since then, Noom has expanded its curricula across the acuity spectrum and now features programs for pre-hypertension, hypertension and diabetes management in addition to its flagship weight loss and diabetes prevention programs. Noom has offices in New York City, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the U.S. alone spends $3.8 trillion dollars on healthcare, and large chunks of that can be saved by shifting more to prevention. The existing healthcare system has no idea how to do this, and that’s where we come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for a VP of Engineering; a leader, someone who will oversee the engineering organization and help evolve Noom technology, all while keeping the team productive and happy. This person will inspire not only the team, but the entire Noom community, and carry us through the technical challenges and opportunities as we set the standard for wellness intelligence.

Noom’s direct-to-consumer weight loss and exercise tracking mobile applications have reached more than 45 million users worldwide. Leveraging the success of their ground-breaking health and fitness programs, Noom developed a behavior change platform to treat chronic and pre-chronic conditions, beginning with the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). On the first day the CDC began recognizing mobile and online DPP providers, Noom was there. Since then, Noom has expanded its curricula across the acuity spectrum and now features programs for pre-hypertension, hypertension and diabetes management in addition to its flagship weight loss and diabetes prevention programs. Noom has offices in New York City, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the U.S. alone spends $3.8 trillion dollars on healthcare, and large chunks of that can be saved by shifting more to prevention. The existing healthcare system has no idea how to do this, and that’s where we come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for a VP of Engineering; a leader, someone who will oversee the engineering organization and help evolve Noom technology, all while keeping the team productive and happy. This person will inspire not only the team, but the entire Noom community, and carry us through the technical challenges and opportunities as we set the standard for wellness intelligence. You will get to lead a team of world-class engineers, help millions of people be healthier, and tackle some of the hardest problem in healthcare and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What You'll Do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Drive technical, architectural, and organizational decisions, making sure we build a scalable, efficient, and maintainable infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>Evolve Noom engineering through best practices, coding guidelines, and design documents, ensuring the organization as a whole feels awesome, top-notch, and fun </li>\r\n<li>Optimize interactions between engineering and other functions, e.g product management, design, marketing, etc. </li>\r\n<li>Help design and refine a scalable engineering culture to accommodate this growth </li>\r\n<li>Be a good career coach and mentor, help engineers grow to be tech leads, and guiding all others towards success</li>\r\n</ul><p>What We're Looking For:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experience leading an engineering team in both a cutting-edge large-scale tech company and in a start-up (team size is less important than what you achieved with it) </li>\r\n<li>An experienced engineer and technical wizard, with the know-how to design complex scalable systems and how to design them correctly </li>\r\n<li>An ability to quickly hold a conceptual and technical grasp of our complex tech stack and infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>A strong leader and great communicator, with a welcoming and supportive personality </li>\r\n<li>Past success creating processes that define a high-quality and enjoyable engineering culture </li>\r\n<li>An inspiring motivator, supporter, and quarterback for the team</li>\r\n</ul>", "website"=>"", "type"=>"Full Time", "apply"=>"<p><a href=\"http://grnh.se/2pl48y1\">http://grnh.se/2pl48y1</a></p>"}, "commit"=>"view", "id"=>"4"}

Noom’s direct-to-consumer weight loss and exercise tracking mobile applications have reached more than 45 million users worldwide. Leveraging the success of their ground-breaking health and fitness programs, Noom developed a behavior change platform to treat chronic and pre-chronic conditions, beginning with the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). On the first day the CDC began recognizing mobile and online DPP providers, Noom was there.

Noom has offices in New York City, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the U.S. alone spends $3.8 trillion dollars on healthcare, and large chunks of that can be saved by shifting more to prevention.

Leveraging the success of their ground-breaking health and fitness programs, Noom developed a behavior change platform to treat chronic and pre-chronic conditions, beginning with the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). On the first day the CDC began recognizing mobile and online DPP providers, Noom was there. Since then, Noom has expanded its curricula across the acuity spectrum and now features programs for pre-hypertension, hypertension and diabetes management in addition to its flagship weight loss and diabetes prevention programs. Noom has offices in New York City, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the U.S. alone spends $3.8 trillion dollars on healthcare, and large chunks of that can be saved by shifting more to prevention.

Noom’s direct-to-consumer weight loss and exercise tracking mobile applications have reached more than 45 million users worldwide. Leveraging the success of their ground-breaking health and fitness programs, Noom developed a behavior change platform to treat chronic and pre-chronic conditions, beginning with the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). On the first day the CDC began recognizing mobile and online DPP providers, Noom was there. Since then, Noom has expanded its curricula across the acuity spectrum and now features programs for pre-hypertension, hypertension and diabetes management in addition to its flagship weight loss and diabetes prevention programs. Noom has offices in New York City, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the U.S. alone spends $3.8 trillion dollars on healthcare, and large chunks of that can be saved by shifting more to prevention. The existing healthcare system has no idea how to do this, and that’s where we come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for a VP of Engineering; a leader, someone who will oversee the engineering organization and help evolve Noom technology, all while keeping the team productive and happy. This person will inspire not only the team, but the entire Noom community, and carry us through the technical challenges and opportunities as we set the standard for wellness intelligence. You will get to lead a team of world-class engineers, help millions of people be healthier, and tackle some of the hardest problem in healthcare and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What You'll Do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Drive technical, architectural, and organizational decisions, making sure we build a scalable, efficient, and maintainable infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>Evolve Noom engineering through best practices, coding guidelines, and design documents, ensuring the organization as a whole feels awesome, top-notch, and fun </li>\r\n<li>Optimize interactions between engineering and other functions, e.g product management, design, marketing, etc. </li>\r\n<li>Help design and refine a scalable engineering culture to accommodate this growth </li>\r\n<li>Be a good career coach and mentor, help engineers grow to be tech leads, and guiding all others towards success</li>\r\n</ul><p>What We're Looking For:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experience leading an engineering team in both a cutting-edge large-scale tech company and in a start-up (team size is less important than what you achieved with it) </li>\r\n<li>An experienced engineer and technical wizard, with the know-how to design complex scalable systems and how to design them correctly </li>\r\n<li>An ability to quickly hold a conceptual and technical grasp of our complex tech stack and infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>A strong leader and great communicator, with a welcoming and supportive personality </li>\r\n<li>Past success creating processes that define a high-quality and enjoyable engineering culture </li>\r\n<li>An inspiring motivator, supporter, and quarterback for the team</li>\r\n</ul>", "website"=>"", "type"=>"", "apply"=>"<p><a href=\"http://grnh.se/2pl48y1\">http://grnh.se/2pl48y1</a></p>"}, "commit"=>"save", "id"=>"4"}

Noom’s direct-to-consumer weight loss and exercise tracking mobile applications have reached more than 45 million users worldwide. Leveraging the success of their ground-breaking health and fitness programs, Noom developed a behavior change platform to treat chronic and pre-chronic conditions, beginning with the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). On the first day the CDC began recognizing mobile and online DPP providers, Noom was there. Since then, Noom has expanded its curricula across the acuity spectrum and now features programs for pre-hypertension, hypertension and diabetes management in addition to its flagship weight loss and diabetes prevention programs. Noom has offices in New York City, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the U.S. alone spends $3.8 trillion dollars on healthcare, and large chunks of that can be saved by shifting more to prevention. The existing healthcare system has no idea how to do this, and that’s where we come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for a VP of Engineering; a leader, someone who will oversee the engineering organization and help evolve Noom technology, all while keeping the team productive and happy. This person will inspire not only the team, but the entire Noom community, and carry us through the technical challenges and opportunities as we set the standard for wellness intelligence. You will get to lead a team of world-class engineers, help millions of people be healthier, and tackle some of the hardest problem in healthcare and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What You'll Do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Drive technical, architectural, and organizational decisions, making sure we build a scalable, efficient, and maintainable infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>Evolve Noom engineering through best practices, coding guidelines, and design documents, ensuring the organization as a whole feels awesome, top-notch, and fun </li>\r\n<li>Optimize interactions between engineering and other functions, e.g product management, design, marketing, etc. </li>\r\n<li>Help design and refine a scalable engineering culture to accommodate this growth </li>\r\n<li>Be a good career coach and mentor, help engineers grow to be tech leads, and guiding all others towards success</li>\r\n</ul><p>What We're Looking For:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experience leading an engineering team in both a cutting-edge large-scale tech company and in a start-up (team size is less important than what you achieved with it) </li>\r\n<li>An experienced engineer and technical wizard, with the know-how to design complex scalable systems and how to design them correctly </li>\r\n<li>An ability to quickly hold a conceptual and technical grasp of our complex tech stack and infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>A strong leader and great communicator, with a welcoming and supportive personality </li>\r\n<li>Past success creating processes that define a high-quality and enjoyable engineering culture </li>\r\n<li>An inspiring motivator, supporter, and quarterback for the team</li>\r\n</ul>", "website"=>"", "type"=>"Full Time", "apply"=>"<p><a href=\"http://grnh.se/2pl48y1\">http://grnh.se/2pl48y1</a></p>"}, "commit"=>"view", "id"=>"4"}

Noom’s direct-to-consumer weight loss and exercise tracking mobile applications have reached more than 45 million users worldwide. Leveraging the success of their ground-breaking health and fitness programs, Noom developed a behavior change platform to treat chronic and pre-chronic conditions, beginning with the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). On the first day the CDC began recognizing mobile and online DPP providers, Noom was there. Since then, Noom has expanded its curricula across the acuity spectrum and now features programs for pre-hypertension, hypertension and diabetes management in addition to its flagship weight loss and diabetes prevention programs. Noom has offices in New York City, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the U.S. alone spends $3.8 trillion dollars on healthcare, and large chunks of that can be saved by shifting more to prevention. The existing healthcare system has no idea how to do this, and that’s where we come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for a VP of Engineering; a leader, someone who will oversee the engineering organization and help evolve Noom technology, all while keeping the team productive and happy. This person will inspire not only the team, but the entire Noom community, and carry us through the technical challenges and opportunities as we set the standard for wellness intelligence. You will get to lead a team of world-class engineers, help millions of people be healthier, and tackle some of the hardest problem in healthcare and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What You'll Do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Drive technical, architectural, and organizational decisions, making sure we build a scalable, efficient, and maintainable infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>Evolve Noom engineering through best practices, coding guidelines, and design documents, ensuring the organization as a whole feels awesome, top-notch, and fun </li>\r\n<li>Optimize interactions between engineering and other functions, e.g product management, design, marketing, etc. </li>\r\n<li>Help design and refine a scalable engineering culture to accommodate this growth </li>\r\n<li>Be a good career coach and mentor, help engineers grow to be tech leads, and guiding all others towards success</li>\r\n</ul><p>What We're Looking For:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experience leading an engineering team in both a cutting-edge large-scale tech company and in a start-up (team size is less important than what you achieved with it) </li>\r\n<li>An experienced engineer and technical wizard, with the know-how to design complex scalable systems and how to design them correctly </li>\r\n<li>An ability to quickly hold a conceptual and technical grasp of our complex tech stack and infrastructure </li>\r\n<li>A strong leader and great communicator, with a welcoming and supportive personality </li>\r\n<li>Past success creating processes that define a high-quality and enjoyable engineering culture </li>\r\n<li>An inspiring motivator, supporter, and quarterback for the team</li>\r\n</ul>", "website"=>"", "type"=>"Full Time", "apply"=>"<p><a href=\"http://grnh.se/2pl48y1\">http://grnh.se/2pl48y1</a></p>"}, "commit"=>"view", "id"=>"4"}
